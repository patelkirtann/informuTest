# informuTest

The main code is in inded.android.js

Since I can only test it on android Emulator, this code has not been tested on any ios devices. 

Since the API provided was not sufficent to fetch all the recoders to complete the mentioned tasks, this project will include only very basic details of movies.

I tried my best to complete as much as I could in this project as I never used React native before.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn this new language.
